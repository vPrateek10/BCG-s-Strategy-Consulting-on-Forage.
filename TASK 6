Hello Assaf,
Two departments that may have concerns/objections are the Chief Commercial Officer and 
the Chief Financial Officer.
Chief Commercial Officer
• May raise concerns about marketing to a younger audience, and this change could be 
confusing for some older customers. It is important to maintain the brand image.
Mitigation
• Carefully plan and launch our marketing campaign, with clear communication to 
customers.
• Exemplify the benefits of handset leasing prior to and during launch. Through platforms 
such as Instagram and Facebook
Chief Financial Officer
• Could have an issue with lower up-front costs that the "Bargain Upgrades Plan" will 
result in. This could affect the top line.
Mitigation
• Comparable markets suggest that increased market share and more attractive plans, as a 
result of handset leasing, tend to outperform the rest of the market in top-line growth. 
(ARPU may decline)
Concerns can be managed by presenting historical data and studies from the industry to 
support the Bargain Upgrades Plan. Driving this proposal through facts should be our 
focus.
Best Regards,
Prateek Verma
