I just completed BCG's Strategy Consulting on Forage. In the simulation I:
Completed a job simulation where I advised a hypothetical local telco company, Company X, facing a decline in profits
Conducted market research to determine the feasibility of the proposed solution
Used excel to build a model to predict the potential profitability of the proposed solution
Communicated a summary of key findings in a clear presentation to stakeholders
