Task 1
Hello Elisse,

Here is my report for our client Company X. Introduction to handset leasing as a means of driving profitability. I recommend the team proceed with the project, as handset leasing has been successful. There is a projection that the telecom industry is poised to grow from USD 1805.61 billion in 2023 to USD 3102.74 billion by 2031. 

The following research supports my recommendation for this project:

Handset leasing is used by competitors for generating multiple sources of income.
The higher adoption of SIM-only plans has had a negative effect on revenue. Consequently, companies have started to offer handset leasing services to accommodate consumer preferences.
There has been a contraction in legacy smartphone usage in the market.
Consumers want lower upfront costs, reduced investment, and access to updated technology.
Handset leasing lowers upfront handset costs by up to 70%, making it particularly popular among youth who lack disposable income.
Consumer are interested in having updated technology.

It is an attractive business model and company X, should further explore this as an source to drive profitability.
